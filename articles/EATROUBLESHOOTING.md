## Troubleshooting MarkLogic External Authentication (LDAP and Active Directory)

## Introduction

MarkLogic Server allows you to configure MarkLogic Server so that users are authenticated using an external authentication protocol, such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Kerberos. These external agents serve as centralized points of authentication or repositories for user information from which authorization decisions can be made.

This article will attempt to give some guidance on how to troubleshoot those connection issues that occur after you have configured MarkLogic server for External Authentcation using LDAP or Active Directory. As far as possible I will avoid repeating what is already in the MarkLogic documentation and to that end I would highly recommend that you make yourself familar with the following online documentation.
